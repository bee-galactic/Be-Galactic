Job Description 
IT Specialist III, Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology - 1800000161 

Description
 

IT Research Specialist III in Bioinformatics 

Job Summary

The Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology, University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture seeks to fill an IT Research Specialist III position to direct and participate in the 

specification, analysis, design, development, maintenance, and documentation of the Tripal software system, a Drupal-based content management system for genetic and genomic scientific 

data (http://tripal.info/). The i5k workspace will be the primary use case. The i5K is an initiative to sequence the genomes of 5,000 arthropod species, and the workspace is the online 

presence for scientists to access, curate, visualize and share the data from the i5k project (https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/).

Job Functions

·         Provides specialized services to include web application design, developing web services, and perform web programming. Tripal is written as a set of PHP-based Drupal modules and is 

the basis of the i5k workspace. In this position, the programmer will maintain and support the existing Drupal/Tripal site as well as develop new modules.

·         Tests and verifies complex technological procedures and evaluates and validates complex information technology processes. Tripal code must utilize unit tests and the developer will be 

expected to implement automated and functional tests for both newly developed code and upgrades to existing code. Server-side monitoring of site health will also need to be developed.

·         Identifies and evaluates the needs, supports, and solves the information technology needs of users. The needs of the i5k workspace and the Tripal software itself evolve as biological and 

genomic science advances, and the specific project will need to be tailored and updated by the developer to reflect this.

·         Consults with a diverse clientele internal and external to the University. This project involves working directly with other Tripal developers at the University of Tennessee, other Tripal 

developers worldwide, collaborators at the USDA ARS, and scientists from all over the world that are using the i5k workspace.

·         Provides direction and leadership in monitoring, assessing, and documenting the information technology infrastructure. The programmer will lead all aspects of new modules as outlined 

below, including developing code on GitHub, providing adequate unit testing, providing detailed documentation, responding to bugs/issues and coordinating development with the larger Tripal 

community.

·         Manages and maintains this project with a significant degree of independence.

·         Responds to medium-scale technical issues without supervision; responds to large-scale technical issues with minimum supervision. The developer will need to address user and site 

needs, respond to github issues and guide developmen with minimum supervision.

·         Possesses in-depth industry knowledge. Prior knowledge of PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL are necessary. Prior experience with Drupal is strongly preferred. Prior experience 

working with biological data (gene and genome sequences, genetic maps) and controlled vocabularies/ontologies preferred.

·         Researches and trains on new technologies as appropriate. Tripal utilizes many biology-specific concepts and relies on various existing technologies that will require independent study. 

For example, Chado (the standard molecular biology relational database schema), BLAST (the DNA sequence similarity search engine) and Jbrowse (the javascript-based genome browser). 

Tripal is also built with extensive use of scientific controlled vocabularies, which the developer will need to become familiar with. Further, new web technologies will need to be integrated into 

Tripal as they become available.

·         Performs advanced level analysis and extensive problem solving as necessary to complete specific assignments. The project involves signficant complexity in integrating software, web, 

data science and biology concepts to guide development of extremely sophisticated web software.

·         Plans and coordinates projects as assigned.

·         Provides guidance to colleagues and users.  As new developers are brought into Tripal, will need to guide them in best software practices and module development. Will need to respond 

to user requests and either undertake creating of i5k site training materials or supervise others in the creation of training materials.

·         May serve as project lead on large sized projects. For example, will need to lead the writing and submission of a peer-reviewed scientific literature article about how Tripal and/or Chado 

should implement FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) data practices into Tripal.

·         Performs other related duties as required. For example, travel to meet the i5k science team and to scientific conferences, presenting information on Tripal and i5k including both 

demonstrations and oral presentations.

Project Examples

·         The developer will lead convertsion of i5k from Tripal v2 to Tripal v3. This includes converting existing custom i5k Workspace modules, for example for organism and gene display, that 

will likely need to be rewritten as new modules.

·         Improve on the i5k Workspace’s NCBI metadata ingest module (in development). Tasks include full implementation of metadata storage, mapping NCBI’s metadata to existing controlled 

vocabularies, expanding the scope from genome assemblies to other datatypes such as gene predictions and RNASeq data.

·         Improve metadata ingest to guide public site users in submitting their own datasets. Development of a Tripal module for this task.

·         Develop site templates and navigation to enable users to retrieve data and metadata in a more genome-centric way.

·         Improve organization and display of gene families or related genes, particularly through use of controlled vocabularies. Development of a gene family module for Tripal.

·         Lead writing of a peer-reviewed publication on how Tripal and/or Chado should implement FAIR data principles.
