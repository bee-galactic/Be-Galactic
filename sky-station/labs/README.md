The sky-station labs will be built as funds become available.

The sky-station labs only test electrons.  

Electrons seem to be the easiest and cheapest thing to test.

The code of ethics for testing electrons requires that no electrons be damaged during testing.

The sea-station labs and land-station labs will be for testing virtual reality entities.

The former bio-station has been closed since the unfortunate incident involving lab cats and lab mice.

A complete review of all protocols for bio-station is underway.

There will be updates on all the labs as the situation warrants.

UPDATE:  The ER1125 project has been approved today 180527.
